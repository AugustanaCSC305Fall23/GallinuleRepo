Welcome to the Gymnastic Lesson Planner App -- your go-to solution for
streamlined lesson planning in the world of gymnastics. Developed using
Java and JavaFX, this application leverages the power of SceneBuilder to

and customizable experience. With Git handling version control, our app
is a reliable and efficient tool to simplify the development,
organization, and visualization of gymnastic lesson plans.

## Technologies Used {#technologies-used}

**Java and JavaFX:** The core application is built using Java, and the
user interface is developed with JavaFX, providing a robust and
platform-independent solution for lesson planning.

**SceneBuilder:** SceneBuilder is employed for designing the graphical
user interface, making it easier to create and modify UI components with
a drag-and-drop approach.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** CSS is utilized to enhance the visual
appeal and customize the look and feel of the application, providing a
more personalized user experience.

**Git:** Git is used for version control, allowing for efficient
collaboration, code management, and easy tracking of changes throughout
the development process.

## Known Issues {#known-issues}

1.  **Limited Course Saving and Loading:** Issue: The current version
    only supports saving and loading a single course, making it
    challenging to manage multiple courses separately.

2.  **Course Import Functionality:** Issue: The application lacks the
    capability to import courses from other sources or share courses
    between users.

3.  **Vertical Printing of Lesson Plan Rows:** Issue: When printing,
    each event row from the lesson plan is printed vertically on
    separate pages, resulting in inefficient paper usage.

4.  **Preview Without Saving Data Loss:** Issue: Clicking on the preview
    button without saving the lesson plan results in the loss of all
    progress, making it crucial to save before previewing.

5.  **Duplicate Lesson Plan Saving:** Issue: Clicking the save button on
    the create plan page multiple times saves the same lesson plan
    multiple times, potentially causing redundancy.
